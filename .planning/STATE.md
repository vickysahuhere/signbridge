# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-11-04)

**Core value:** Real-time, privacy-preserving, zero-server-cost two-way communication between Deaf ISL signers and hearing text users running 100% in the browser with <50ms message latency and >=30 FPS vision tracking.  
**Current focus:** Phase 2: The Math

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 6 (The Math)  
Plan: 0 of 2 in current phase (02-01, 02-02 planned across 2 waves)  
Status: Ready to execute  
Last activity: 2026-11-05 — Planned Phase 2 (The Math): coordinate normalization, 30-frame RingBuffer, wrist velocity motion gating, and unit tests

Progress: [██████░░░░] 60%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 4.0 min
- Total execution time: 0.2 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. The Eyes | 3/3 | 12 min | 4 min |
| 2. The Math | 0/2 | - | - |
| 3. The Brain (Part 1) | 0/2 | - | - |
| 4. The Brain (Part 2) | 0/2 | - | - |
| 5. The Linguist | 0/2 | - | - |
| 6. The Bridge | 0/3 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 3 plans: 4 min, 4 min, 4 min
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [Phase 1]: Used `videoElement.requestVideoFrameCallback()` with fallback to `requestAnimationFrame` for hardware V-Sync.
- [Phase 1]: MediaPipe Holistic isolated in dedicated Web Worker (`vision.worker.js`) with WebGL GPU acceleration and Cache Storage caching.
- [Phase 1]: Precompiled WebGL shaders during worker boot with a dummy frame warm-up.
- [Phase 1]: Left Hand bones drawn in Sky Blue (`#38BDF8`), Right Hand bones in Emerald Green (`#34D399`).
- [Phase 2]: Filter down 543 landmarks to 80 critical keypoints (240 floats) for scale- and translation-invariance.
- [Phase 2]: Zero-pad missing hands with `0.0` (zero `NaN` values).
- [Phase 2]: Shoulder midpoint centering and shoulder width scaling for distance invariance.
- [Phase 2]: 30-frame circular RingBuffer for temporal models.
- [Phase 2]: Rolling 5-frame wrist velocity motion energy gating with 1.2s idle hand pause auto-commit.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
